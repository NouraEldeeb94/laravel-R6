<h1>PUT vs PATCH</h1>

- PUT
    <p>PUT is a method of modifying the entire resource so you have to send all the parameters including those not to be updated in the request body</p>

- PATCH 
    <p>Unlike PUT Request, It does partial update e.g. Fields that need to be updated by User, only that field is updated without modifying the other field.</p>
